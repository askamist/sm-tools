# sm-tools 

This repo originally had only one tool geohash to kml, however have decided to
change it to include multiple tools in this same repo. as I don't want them to
be in n number of repo's. might decide otherwise in future.

Tools included

1. geohash-to-kml - A tool to generate kml files from both geohash list or lat-lng values.
2. frames-to-timestamp - A tool to convert from number of frames to timestamp of a video file and vice versa.
3. add-timestamps - A tool to add multiple timestamps and get the total value

and the idea is to include all small conversion tools in future.

TODO:

- Figure out how to add tests
- upgrade to vue 3.0
