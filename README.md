# geohash-to-kml

This repo originally had only one tool geohash to kml, however have decided to
change it to include multiple tools in this same repo. as I don't want them to
be in n number of repo's. might decide otherwise in future.

Tools included

1. geohash-to-kml - A tool to generate kml files from both geohash list or lat-lng values.
2. frames-to-timestamp - A tool to convert from frames to timestamp and vice versa.

and the idea is to include all small conversion tools in future.
